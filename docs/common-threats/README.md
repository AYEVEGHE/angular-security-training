# 2- Common Threats

In this chapter we will focus on the following threats raised in OWASP Top 10 2017 and 2021:

- **Identification and Authentication Failures**: we will use JWT for this training
- **Injections**: 
  - CSRF: Cross Site Requests Forgery
  - XSS: Cross Site Scripting
  - SSTI: Template Injection
  - XSSI: JSON Hijacking
  
- **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**

- **Unprotected APIs**

For each threat, we will have an **overview** and recommended **defense** mechanisms to implement globally with Angular.

A **Practical Work** session is available when necessary.
