# 2.1 XSS Overview 

## XSS in a nutshell

XSS (Cross Site Scripting) happens when an attacker enters a malicious script in a web application through a web request.

The script is included in dynamic content that is reflected back to the victim's web browser without validation for malicious content.

## Why is XSS dangerous ?

The impact of XSS is moderate for reflected and DOM XSS, and severe for stored XSS, with remote code execution on the victimâ€™s browser, such as stealing credentials, sessions, MFA bypass, DOM node replacement or defacement (such as trojan login panels), key logging or delivering malware to the victim.

## What causes XSS ?

This attack happens mostly because the web application or API uses inputs from any users within the output it generates without proper validation or encoding.
