# 3.1 XSS Overview 

## XSS in a nutshell

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web application vulnerability that occurs when **untrusted data from the user** is processed by the web application **without validation** and is reflected back to the browser **without encoding or escaping**, resulting in code execution at the browser engine.

## Why XSS is dangerous ?

The impact of XSS is moderate for reflected and DOM XSS, and severe for stored XSS, with remote code execution on the victimâ€™s browser, such as stealing credentials, sessions, MFA bypass, DOM node replacement or defacement (such as trojan login panels), key logging or delivering malware to the victim.

## What causes XSS ?

This attack happens mostly because the web application or API uses inputs from any users within the output it generates without proper validation or encoding.
