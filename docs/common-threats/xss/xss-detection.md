# 3.2 XSS Detection

## Is my application vulnerable to XSS ?

XSS vulnerabilities are difficult to identify and completely be removed from web applications or API.

- **Review** new code by a knowledgeable person in secure coding.
- **SAST** scans are  capable to detect vulnerable code which could allow XSS attacks.
- **DAST** tools such as OWASP ZAP can scan your application and help you detect exploitable flaws allowing XSS.
